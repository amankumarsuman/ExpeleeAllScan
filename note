he transaction type can be determined based on the address of the to field and from field of the transaction.

Transfer Transactions: If the to field of the transaction is not the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000), it is a transfer transaction.

Contract Creation: If the to field is the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) and the input field of the transaction is not empty, it means that the transaction is creating a new contract.

Contract Call: If the to field is not the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) and the input field of the transaction is not empty, it means that the transaction is calling a method on a contract.

Token Transfer: If the to field is the contract address of a token, and the input field of the transaction is a function call to the transfer method of that contract, it means that the transaction is a token transfer.

Minting: There is no standard way to detect minting transactions. However, if the to field is the contract address of a token, and the input field of the transaction is a function call to a method that can mint tokens, it might be a minting transaction. But it's important to check the contract code and ABI to be sure.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list and there may be other types of transactions that can occur on a blockchain.
